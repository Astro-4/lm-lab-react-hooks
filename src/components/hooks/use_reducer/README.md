# useReducer

`useReducer` is a React Hook that lets you add a reducer to your component.

### What is a reducer?

Components can get complicated - fast! A component with many state updates spread across many event handlers (onClick/onChanges etc) can become overwhelming. üòÖ

For cases like this, you can extract state logic for a component into a single function, known as a reducer. This can make things a bit more manageable‚Äîphew!

üëâ Make yourself familiar with the files in `hooks/use_reducer`

## The Mission

In the `use_reducer` folder there are a variety of different files. These files contain a code example taken directly from the React documentation on `use_reducer`.

Your mission is to use the React documentation to refactor these files so they use `useReducer` and make use of `actions`.

Note: The React documentation contains solution code for this exercise - try to work it out without peeking at the solution!

## Have I solved this challenge correctly?

If you have implemented useReducer correctly...

## Food For Thought

-   What does `useReducer` do?

-   What is a "reducer"?

-   What is an "action"
